Assembler Function Macros
Functions are requested by the MXTABLES Macro. The API function to u
se is given by function.


Create a table
This function create a system wide shared table within Matrix. If Ma
trix is running sysplex enabled, this table will be known to all ins
tances of Matrix within the sysplex. All of the components of the ta
ble must be prepared and ready before this macro is performed. The V
irtual Work Areas for index and data must have been created before t
his command is issued. See Matrix Assembler Programming Reference Ma
nual for details on how to create VWA's.

Allocate a cell in a varying cell length table.
When a table array with varying length cells is created, each cell i
s unallocated and has a length of zero. To be able to access a cell
it must have a size. Allocating a cell sets the size of the specifie
d cell. After it has been allocated the cell may be written to and r
ead from.
